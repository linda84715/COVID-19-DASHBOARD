# COVID-19 Dashboard

This project is an interactive COVID-19 dashboard built in Jupyter Notebook using:

- **Public Health England COVID-19 API** for live data
- **pandas** for data wrangling
- **matplotlib** for visualisation
- **ipywidgets** for interactive controls
- **Voila** for deployment as a browser-based dashboard

Key features:

- Fetches the latest COVID-19 hospital data via an API refresh button
- Compares new hospital admissions and ventilator bed occupancy over time
- Allows users to explore different visualisation options through widgets
- Runs as a clean, code-free dashboard through Voila

Launch the dashboard in Binder:
